# JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures

Final five challenges from the JavaScript course at the [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/).

It took me about 4-5 weeks of afternoon and evening hours to go through all 299 challenges at the given course and these 5 are the final ones. It was a very nice journey, I enjoyed a lot and I hope you'll find some enjoyment too.

Before you check the solutions, I strongly encourage you to try it yourself! If you can't see a solution or frustrated working on it, you are not alone, just take a break, do something else and return to the problem later.

Complete these **5 JavaScript projects** to earn the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification.
